The Rest Call - Headers

We can modify the default request headers by setting a "header" property.
For example if we want to declare the use of UTF8 we do the following
    headers:
      Content-Type: "application/json; charset=UTF-8"

The Rest Call - Cookies.
The property cookies allows u to specify cookies to use with the Rest call.
Very often used for personalization, session management and tracking. An example

    cookies:
      NEW_USER: newUser

The REST Call - Query Parameters.
Instead of adding query parameters to the path, we can define them with the property 
'queryParameters', and inside this property, key and value of variables to use

  single:
    method: get
    entityClass: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode
    path: /posts
    queryParameters:
      id: "{id}"
