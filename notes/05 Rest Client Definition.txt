The rest client definition - Class and schema URL

Class property defines the backend Java class definition to be used by this Rest Client.
Magnolia provides with two options
Default is  info.magnolia.rest.client.ConfiguredRestClientDefinition 

example of configured class
class: info.magnolia.openapi.client.OpenApiRestClientDefinition


7 The rest client definition - Client factory class

clientFactoryClass is the java class that does heavy lifting

rarely used anyway

The default value is fine to be used

There are two defaults
if we are using
ConfiguredRestClientDefinition, the value is
clientFactoryClass: info.magnolia.rest.client.factory.DefaultClientFactory


if we use the the OpenApiRestClientDefinition then the value is

clientFactoryClass: info.magnolia.openapi.client.factory.OpenApiClientFactory

The rest client definition - Components

it is possible to add a
list of componentes
 java classes that override other classes

like
  - javax.ws.rs.client.ClientRequestFilter
  - javax.ws.rs.client.ClientResponseFilter

that are executed after each request

sample definitions of components
com.mycompany.jaxrs.MyCustomClientResponseFilter
com.mycompany.jaxrs.MyCustomClientRequestFilter

10
The rest client definition - enabled and name

If we want to disable a rest client, we put a property 
enable: false

Useful for testing and maintenance

If we want to set the name of the rest client to other thing that the name of the file
name: posts # You shouldn't set this as the file name will set this value.
we can usethe property name and set a name. It is recommended to not do this to avoid future confusions.


11
The Rest Client Definition - Exception Handler Class.

To customize behaviours of exceptions we create a class that extends
javax.ws.rs.WebApplicationException.
exceptionHandlerClass: com.mycompany.jaxrs.MyCustomExceptionHandler

We set the exceptionHandlerClass property com.mycompany.jaxrs.MyCustomExceptionHandler
therefore we can handle Rest codes like
404
501 and more

The Rest Client Definition - Proxies. 
Just add them to the proxies property
The proxy definition must extend 
info.magnolia.rest.client.proxy.ProxyDefinition

examples

proxies:
  myFirstProxy: com.mycompany.jaxrs.MyFirstProxyDefinition
  mySecondProxy: com.mycompany.jaxrs.MySecondProxyDefinition
